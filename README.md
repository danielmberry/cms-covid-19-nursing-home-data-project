## Problem Statement

COVID-19 has disproportionately affected residents of long-term care facilities, [with these facilities constituting less than 1 percent of the U.S. population yet 43 percent of all COVID-19 deaths](https://www.aarp.org/caregiving/health/info-2020/covid-19-nursing-homes-an-american-tragedy.html). In order to convey the impact of COVID-19 on nursing homes, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) needs a visualization tool that illustrates how nursing homes in various regions of the country dealt with the pandemic. The goal of this project is to create a visualization dashboard and time-series models that illustrate  the performance nursing homes in a state to better anticipate potential spikes in COVID-19 cases and predict where government resources need to be redirected by utilizing data provided by the [Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services](https://data.cms.gov/Special-Programs-Initiatives-COVID-19-Nursing-Home/COVID-19-Nursing-Home-Dataset/s2uc-8wxp).

## Background

Long-term care facilities, also known as nursing homes, have been some of the most devastated communities during the COVID-19 pandemic. By early May, the [*New York Times*](https://www.aarp.org/caregiving/health/info-2020/covid-19-nursing-homes-an-american-tragedy.html) identified more than 36,000 cases and more than 7,000 deaths in nursing homes, almost a month before the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services began tracking COVID-19 data in nursing homes. As a result, our modeling data and infographics do not capture the earliest days of COVID-19 in nursing homes, but we are able to analyze the subsequent responses by nursing homes across the country. It is especially important to analyze this time period to ensure that nursing homes do not regress to the level of carnage present in the early days of the pandemic. Therefore, the guiding question for this project is: **Which states have responded the best and worst to the pandemic, and how can we use this information to ensure that the necessary materials are available for facilities who may be at risk of future breakouts?**

## Data 

For this project, we utilized the COVID-19 Nursing Home Dataset provided by the [Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services](https://data.cms.gov/Special-Programs-Initiatives-COVID-19-Nursing-Home/COVID-19-Nursing-Home-Dataset/s2uc-8wxp) (CMS), which is a collection of COVID-19 data from nursing homes across the country . Center for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) mandates that 100% of nursing homes reports the data required by the Secretary of Health and Human Services:

* Suspected and confirmed COVID-19 infections among residents and staff, including residents previously treated for COVID-19
* Total deaths and COVID-19 deaths among residents and staff
* Personal protective equipment and hand hygiene supplies in the facility
* Ventilator capacity and supplies in the facility
* Resident beds and census
* Access to COVID-19 testing while the resident is in the facility
* Staffing shortages

To acquire the data, we downloaded raw CSV files by week reported from the CMS website. We then concatenated all of the data into one large DataFrame that encapsulated every week's worth of data at the beginning of each notebook. There were several different datatypes included in the dataset (described below) that forced an extensive cleaning process. Our cleaning process first began with breaking data into numerical and text-based data. Most of the text-based data was in fact binary "Yes" or "No" responses that required us to binarize the data into 1's and 0's. The remaining text data described the name of the nursing home and the address of the nursing home, so we did not process this data in our ensuing model. The numeric data, on the other hand, could be broken down into dates, geo-locations, and counts. We processed the dates for our time series modeling,the geolocations for our nursing home visualization dashboard, and the supplies/resident/staff counts for our time series modeling. The primary cleaning step involved imputing values for our null values through groupby-operations that allowed us to impute avergaes based on location for the numeric data rather than just imputing zeros. 

There are several limitations to the dataset beside nursing homes. For example, nursing homes were not required to report COVID-19 data retroactive to the beginning of the pandemic, which resulted in some facilities reporting higher numbers of cases/deaths compared to other facilities due to their retrospective reporting [source](https://www.cms.gov/files/document/covid-nursing-home-data-release-external-faqs.pdf). Furthermore, a facility’s access to COVID-19 testing may impact their reported data. For example, facilities that did not have the ability to test all residents would not be able to report all residents with confirmed cases.
